a. i have finally got the time to start this project. however finals and everything are coming up later this week so i think my consistency with working on this project will be a bit all over the place. i understand the concept of b-trees so i shouldn't have much trouble figuring out what the project wants me to do. i do wish we didnt have 2 hws due around the same time as this, but i will try my best to make progress.
b. the goal of this session is to understand the project requirements and figure out what backrgound research i need to do in order to work on this project.

a. from what i understand, i am using a b-tree to create and manage index files. there are specific formats for the index files, the nodes of the b-tree, and the header of index files. additionally, there are 6 main functions/commands that the user can do. to prep for the next session, i will refresh on code implementation of b-trees. i think the first thing i want to implement is reading the command line inputs and making sure it is valid and handled properly. after this, i will move onto b-tree structure implementation, then file i/o handling.
