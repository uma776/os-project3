# os-project3

Description the current files and their roles:
- the main file you need to run are main.cpp
- the main.cpp has all the code needed for the project functionality

How to compile/run the program from the command line:
- make sure you have the main.cpp file downloaded
- you can compile all the files at once. the following commands i used in VS Code are:
        <br/> g++ -o project3 main.cpp
- you can use the following commands to do the project
        <br/> ./project3 create test.idx
        <br/> ./project3 load test.idx data.csv
        <br/> ./project3 search test.idx 42
        <br/> ./project3 print test.idx
        <br/> ./project3 extract test.idx output.csv
- if you are running this on cs1 or cs2, use the appropriate commands to compile the files.

Anything you want to tell the TA before grading starts:
- You just need to run the g++ command that is provided above and everything should work properly. Please let me know if something doesn't work.
